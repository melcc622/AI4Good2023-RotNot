# AI4Good2023-RotNot
AI4GOOD LAB 2023

I'm thrilled to share my incredible experience at the AI4Good Lab, a 7-week women+ AI lab this summer! 🚀✨ It has been an enlightening journey, delving into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and its impact on society. The lab has truly opened my eyes to the critical importance of AI ethics and the realization that good intentions alone are not enough. 💡

During the lab, my team and I had the privilege of working on an amazing project called RotNot. 🍎🌽🍅 Our mission was to combat global food waste using the power of AI. 🌍✊ We utilized ResNet, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to develop an innovative solution that generates freshness scores for fruits and vegetables. 🍏🥦🍊 By accurately assessing the freshness of produce, we can help prevent unnecessary waste and promote a sustainable future. ♻️🌱

I am immensely grateful to the AI4GoodLab and my incredible teammates Abeer Waheed, Ananya Rao, Claudia Wu, and Tatianna MacKenzie for their support, dedication, and collaborative spirit throughout this journey. I couldn't have asked for a better team. ❤️

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the AI4GoodLab organizers, Christina Isaicu and Yosra Kazemi, our TA Jake Tuero, our mentor Marc Lanctot, and industry experts who made this experience possible. Your guidance and expertise have shaped my understanding of AI's potential for good and reinforced my commitment to championing ethical AI initiatives. 🙏🌟🌍
